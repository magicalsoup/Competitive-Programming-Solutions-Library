  >All solutions that are on wcipeg work on Wcipeg, but may fail on edge cases.  
  There are analysis for problems, they may contain the offical solution or the steps, notes, tips and insight to help you solve the       problem, they are in the analysis folder labeled the same name as the solution, lots of analysis are not there because either the problem is trival (Easy) or the analysis has not been done yet, for those who like a bit of hints and don't want the solution, I suggest you go to the analysis folder to see what you can find
